Module 4 Challenge

The code in the Jupyter notebook ananlyzes the reading and math scores of fifteen different schools. The data is broken down into several different categories to see if we can identify trends that are correlated with higher or lower test scores. We grouped the data by school size, grade level, school budget, and school type (district vs. charter) for this analysis.

The Jupyter notebook also contains information regarding the conclusions drawn from the data analysis.
